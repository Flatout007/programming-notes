# ```Hashing```


```c
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5
// and so on ...
```
:heavy_check_mark: According to the above ```code```,
DAB converts to 412,and BAD converts to 214.
This process of taking ```characters``` and converting them to 
```numbers``` is known as ```hashing```. 

:heavy_check_mark: The ```code``` that is used to 
convert those ```letters``` into particular ```numbers``` 
is called a ```hash function```.

:heavy_check_mark: Another example of a ```hash function```
is to ```return``` the product of all the ```letters```â€™ 
corresponding ```numbers.``` This would convert the word BAD into the ```number``` 8
- Step #1: First, BAD converts to 214.
- Step #2: We then take the product of these digits:
