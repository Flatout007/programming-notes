
# ```O(log N)```

:heavy_check_mark: Simply put, ```O(log N)``` is the Big O way of describing an algorithm that
increases one step each time the _```data is doubled```_

# ```Logarithms```

:heavy_check_mark: Logarithms are the inverse of exponents. Hereâ€™s a quick refresher on what
exponents are:
```2 pow 3```
is the equivalent of:
```2 * 2 * 2```
which just happens to be ```8```.

:heavy_check_mark: Now, ```log2 8``` is the converse of the above. It means: how many times do you
have to multiply ```2``` by itself to get a result of ```8```?

:heavy_check_mark: Since you have to multiply ```2``` by itself ```3``` times to get ```8```, ```log2 8 = 3```. 

**N.B**
_We can also say how many times do we have to divide by 2 before the number is reduced to 1 ?_

*Its that simple.*
